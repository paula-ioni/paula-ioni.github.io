 <h1>How the ban of international tourists affected the economy of Japan 
     during COVID-19?</h1>
<p class="sub"> Project by Paula Ionita, BSc Economics & Econometrics </p>
<p class="body1"> One of the most famous tourist attractions of East Asia and the third most powerful economy in the globe,
  Japan continues to suffer like many other nations since the pandemic was officially declared by WHO. As host of
  Summer Olympics 2020, it was expected to boost the economy greatly. For the first time in history, it was postponed
  for 2021 and no spectators were allowed. The short-term benefits before the pandemic were predicted at around $109 billion,
  with inbound tourists as the main drive force of this enormous number (Hornyak, 2021).
  The aim of my project is to analyse how the ban of international tourists, that has been on going 
  since March 2020, affected some of the key economics measurements.
  
</p>



  

<p> First, let’s compare the number or international arrivals from 2019 – the last prosperous year in terms of tourism, 
  with 2020 data. Finally, I plotted inbound arrivals during COVID, from 2020 and 2021

  An important economic factor related to tourism is the amount of money visitors spend while in the country.
   These numbers count towards the exports of Japan, in our case.

  However, tourism contributes very less to the GDP, compared to other countries. Even before the pandemic,
   tourism as a percentage of GDP has been maintained at just under 2%.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
The drastic reduction of international visitors seems like a difficult situation of Japan. Over the years, 
receipts from international tourists were gradually increasing and kept at high levels, compared to other 
countries. As a percentage of exports, the number was rising every year, going from 1% up to 4% just before 
COVID. However, the total number of exports did not seem to be affected by the 99% reduction of oversea tourists.
Neither before the pandemic Japan was relying on tourism for their GDP, being kept at around 2% every year.
Concluding, Japan was not hit too hard by closing the borders to foreigners, even if the flow of inbound 
tourists was very profitable.

<h2>Data and challenges in obtaining it</h2>
<p>
Half of my data was obtained by scraping via Python and the other one by downloading
CSV files and adapting them for Vega-Lite charting. My most advanced collecting data
method was by scraping a dynamic website with Selenium and a PDF, then editing the 
obtained data on Python as well. I got FRED data from their API by using Python, since 
the direct link of the API would not work in Vega. The CSVs were downloaded from WorldBank 
and OECD, then modified a little bit in Excel so Vega would comprehend the data properly for charting. 

</p>

<p>

  My biggest challenge was definitely scraping the dynamic website with the use of the zombie browser 
  Selenium. I had to get Python directly into my laptop and implicitly getting additional programmes. 
  It was difficult to find each element by XPATH as it required to learn a new method of finding HTML objects. 
  I also encountered two iFrames into the website, but luckily I managed to find the separate link for one of them 
  and scraping that instead. 
The PDF was scraped first with Tabula extension, and then I edited the table and merged it with the one I found
 from scraping with Selenium, which was a bit tricky at the beginning but managed to compile them successfully.
Another challenge was the date format for my scraped data. Since I got data by months, I could not include the year
 in the format because Vega would format my graph wrong. After finding a good format, Vega would treat all of my dates 
 as January 1st, January 2nd and not as January 1st and February 1st. I had to change it so the month would be shown first.
