 <h1>How the ban of international tourists affected the economy of Japan 
     during COVID-19?  </h1>
<p class="sub"> Project by Paula Ionita, BSc Economics & Econometrics </p>
<p> One of the most famous tourist attractions of East Asia and 
    the third most powerful economy in the globe, Japan still continues
    to suffer like many other nations since the pandemic was officialy
    declared by WHO.It was the country chosen to host Summer Olympics of 2020. 
    The event was highly anticipated as it was expected to boost the economy greatly. 
    For the first time in history, it was postponed for 2021 and no spectators were allowed. 
    The short-term benefits before the pandemic were predicted at around $109 billion, with 
    inbound tourists as the main drive force of this enormous number (Hornyak, 2021). Economist
    Kuichi predicted in June a benefit of $16 billion, not a great loss but compared to previous
    number it is far below the target.
